##  Installation

In order to install the Awzpact login system with role, please follow these steps:

1. Search for the folder SOURCE_CODE in the main script folder that you have downloaded.
2. Now upload the SOURCE_CODE folder into your server using FTP or in Localhost(I have used XAMPP).
3. Create mysql database using cpanel or your hosting provider's system or in localhost. Then import the awzpact_db.sql file (that you got into the script's DATABASE folder) into your created database.
4. Now you will have to setup the config and database file. If you are familier with codeigniter, you should know about it. But don't worry! I will tell step by step.
5. Go to the SOURCE_CODE folder, then application and then config folder.
6.You will get two files config.php and database.php
