2. Now upload the SOURCE_CODE folder into your server using FTP or in Localhost(I have used XAMPP).
3. Create mysql database using cpanel or your hosting provider's system or in localhost. Then import the awzpact_db.sql file (that you got into the script's DATABASE folder) into your created database.
